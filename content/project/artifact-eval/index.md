A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond
the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw
survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on.
In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the
document itself.

My involvement in artifact evaluation efforts in the systems, security and HPC
communities have led to a growing understanding of building reusable and
reproducible artifacts. We continuously work on the process to lower the burden
on the authors and ease the reproduction of results for evaluators.
