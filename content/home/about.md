# About

I'm interested in analyzing, desiging, building and evaluating software systems. During my PhD I focused on systems providing data confidentiality and integrity for persistent and in-memory data. I'm glad to collaborate with my co-advisors Peter Druschel and Deepak Garg as well as fellow students Eslam Elnikety and Aastha Mehta.
