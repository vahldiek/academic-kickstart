abstract = """A method and apparatus for multi-dimensional attestations for a software application. A multi-dimensional attestation is generated for at least one component of the software application. The multi-dimensional attestation includes a signed attestation for the at least one component and an attestation reference to at least one other related component. A verifier obtains multi-dimensional attestations for the components of the software application and obtains the signed attestation for the related components of the software application based on the attestation reference and verifies integrity of at least part of the software application based on the obtained signed attestations. The multi-dimensional attestation for a given component of a software application can link attestations across spatial and temporal dimensions including other microservice(s) that communicates directly with the subject microservice, imported code dependencies on which the subject microservice is dependent, and/or the underlying software layer of the subject microservice."""
