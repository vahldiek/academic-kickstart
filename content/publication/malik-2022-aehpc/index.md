abstract = "A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself. Based on the success of the Artifact Evaluation efforts at other systems conferences, the 2021 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC21) organized a comprehensive Artifact Description/Artifact Evaluation (AD/AE) review and competition as part of the SC21 Reproducibility Initiative. This paper summarizes the key findings of the AD/AE effort."
