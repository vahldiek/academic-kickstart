abstract = """Artifact Evaluation (“AE”) is now an accepted practice in the
systems community. However, AE processes are inconsistent across venues and even
across different editions of the same venue. AE processes regularly encounter
the same problems across venues and years. Based on our collective experience in
chairing various and heterogeneous AE committees for five consecutive editions
of EuroSys, a large systems conference, we present the challenges we believe
most pressing. We propose concrete steps to address these challenges in future
AEs, serving as guidelines for future chairs and AE committees."""
