abstract = """Attestation of operations by tool chains is described. An example of a storage medium includes instructions for receiving source code for processing of a secure workload of a tenant; selecting at least a first compute node to provide computation for the workload; processing the source code by an attestable tool chain to generate machine code for the first compute node, including performing one or more conversions of the source code by one or more convertors to generate converted code and generating an attestation associated with each code conversion, and receiving machine code for the first compute node and generating an attestation associated with the first compute node; and providing each of the attestations from the first stage and the second stage for verification."""
