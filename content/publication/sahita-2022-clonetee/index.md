An example of a computer-readable storage medium includes instructions for receiving a selection of a point to capture a snapshot of a baseline trust domain (TD) or secure enclave, the TD or secure enclave being associated with a trusted execution environment (TEE) of a processor utilized for processing of a workload; initiating cloning of the TD or secure enclave from a source platform to an escrow platform; generating an escrow key to export the snapshot to the escrow platform; and exporting a state of the TD or secure enclave to the escrow platform, the state being sealed with a sealing key."""
