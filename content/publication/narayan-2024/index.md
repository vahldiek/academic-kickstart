abstract = """Hardware-assisted fault isolation (HFI) is a minimal extension to current processors that supports secure, flexible, and efficient in-process isolation. HFI addresses the limitations of existing software-based fault isolation (SFI) systems, including runtime overheads, limited scalability, vulnerability to Spectre attacks, and limited compatibility with existing code and binaries. HFI can be seamlessly integrated into existing SFI systems (e.g., WebAssembly) or directly sandbox unmodified native binaries. To ease adoption, HFI relies only on incremental changes to existing high-performance processors."""
