abstract = """Motivated by developer productivity, serverless computing, and
microservices have become the de facto development model in the cloud.
Microservices decompose monolithic applications into separate functional units
deployed individually. This deployment model, however, costs CSPs a large
infrastructure tax of more than 25%. To overcome these limitations, CSPs shift
workloads to Infrastructure Processing Units (IPUs) like Amazonâ€™s Nitro or,
complementary, innovate by building on memory-safe languages and novel software
abstractions.

Based on these trends, we hypothesize a MemorySafe Software and Hardware
Architecture providing a general-purpose runtime environment to specialize
functionality when needed and strongly isolate components. To achieve this goal,
we investigate building a single address space OS or a multi-application library
OS, possible hardware implications, and demonstrate their capabilities,
drawbacks and requirements. The goal is to bring the advantages to all
application workloads including legacy and memory-unsafe applications, and
analyze how hardware may improve the efficiency and security."""
