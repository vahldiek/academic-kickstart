abstract = """Motivated by developer productivity, serverless computing, microservices or
Function and a Service (FaaS) have become the de facto development mode by cloud
service providers (CSPs). The logical decomposition, however, costs CSPs a large
infrastructure tax of more than 25%. To overcome these limitations, CSPs shift workloads to
Infrastructure Processing Units (IPUs) like Amazon's Nitro
or, complementary, innovate by building on memory-safe languages and novel
software abstractions.

Based on these trends, we hypothesize a memory-safe hardware and software
architecture providing a general-purpose runtime environment to specialize
functionality when needed and strongly isolate components. To achieve this goal,
we investigate building a single address space OS or a multi-application library
OS, possible hardware implications, and  demonstrate their capabilities,
drawbacks and requirements. The goal is to bring the advantages to all
application workloads including legacy and memory-unsafe applications, and
analyze how hardware may improve the efficiency and security."""
